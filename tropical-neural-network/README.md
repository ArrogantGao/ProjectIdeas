## Description

Regular neural networks have been widely used in machine learning tasks, such as image recognition and natural language processing. They use real numbers as the basis for their operations.
However, Tropical numbers stand out as they map addition to max and multiplication to regular addition. These unique numbers are recognized for their semiring algebra, lacking the additive inverse operation, subtraction. In my previous research[^Liu2023], I uncovered a significant link between reasoning and Tropical algebra. I successfully transformed a challenging constraint satisfaction problem into a Tropical tensor network. This discovery has inspired me to delve deeper into the potential of Tropical linear algebra in the realm of machine learning. This project aims to explore the capabilities of Tropical algebra in enhancing machine learning processes, particularly in the context of reasoning tasks. By designing and comparing Tropical neural networks with conventional models, we hope to shed light on the potential advantages of this innovative approach.
